## Project Title: HR DATA ANALYSIS REPORT

### Project  Overview: HR Data Report contains various columns that describe employee demographics, job details, and performance metrics and The "Map Data" sheet provides geographical and demographic information

### Project Objective: To analyze employee attrition patterns and identify factors contributing to turnover, performance, and work-life balance. The aim is to uncover insights that could inform retention strategies, optimize HR processes, and improve organizational performance.



. Key columns include:

Attrition: Indicates if an employee has left the company.

Business Travel: Frequency of travel required by the employee.

Age Band and Gender: Demographic details.

Department and Job Role: Employment details.

Education Field: Employee’s educational background.

Performance Rating and Work Life Balance: Ratings related to performance and work-life balance.

Years at Company and Years with Current Manager: Tenure information.


I'll now review the "Map Data" sheet to determine its role in the analysis.




map data, including:

States: Names of various states.

Longitude and Latitude: Geographical coordinates.

Population (2006) and Population (2019): Population data for two years.


This sheet may support a regional analysis or mapping of employee data if geographic patterns are relevant in the HR dataset.

Draft Report Structure

Here's an outline for your analysis report based on these findings:


Scope
This analysis covers various HR aspects including employee demographics, job characteristics, performance metrics, and attrition rates. Additionally, regional population data is available, potentially supporting geographical analysis.

Data Collection
The dataset consists of two main components:

1. Employee Data: Contains demographic, employment, and performance-related data.


2. Geographical Data: Includes state-level population and coordinates, potentially linking employee data with regional trends.



Data Collected
Key variables in the employee data include:

Demographics: Age, gender, education field.

Job Details: Department, role, business travel.

Performance Metrics: Ratings for performance, work-life balance.

Tenure Information: Years at the company and with the current manager.

Geographical Information (optional): Based on state data from the Map Data sheet.


Analysis Tools

Data Analysis: Python and Excel for initial data cleaning and descriptive statistics.

Data Visualization: Power BI for interactive visualizations.

Mapping (if applicable): Use geographical data to analyze trends across states.


Analytical Approach

1. Descriptive Analysis: Summarize employee demographics and job characteristics.


2. Attrition Analysis: Explore patterns of attrition across different demographic and job-related factors.


3. Performance & Satisfaction Analysis: Assess how various factors, like years at the company or department, influence employee performance and satisfaction ratings.


4. Geographical Analysis (optional): Examine potential correlations between attrition and regional population characteristics.
